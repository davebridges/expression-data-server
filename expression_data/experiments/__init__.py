'''The experiments app describes various types of gene expression experiments.

The goals of this app are to:

* Link experimental data (the :mod:`data` app) with genes (the :mod:`genes` app).
* Centralize and rationalize metadata for an experiment such as analysis conditions, researchers and samples.
* Provide a convenient way to list all inputted data.
