This folder contains the raw data, which is then parsed to populate the gene tables.

The gene names table is generated from ENSEMBL Mus musculus build NCBIM37 and was downloaded from biomart.
The bookmark for this table is http://central.biomart.org/martanalysis/#!/Gene retrieval/Ensembl?ds=mmusculus_gene_ensembl&preview=true as results.txt then renamed as gene_names.txt
